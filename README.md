A simple application that will allow you to easily look at your instagram account while working with Mac. 💻

I actually prepared this application to meet my own need. I had to look at the phone every time to look at Instagram comments and messages. And when I picked up the phone, I was distracted. 📱😬

This app have prepared with electron.js. 

The packaged app is in the following path:  
`release-builds/Instagram for MacOS-darwin-x64/Instagram for MacOS.app`

I hope it will help you 👍
